# SHCMData
SHsuperCM's data solution



SHCMData is a (WIP) library that should hopefully make a smart sensible
data storage solution for java.

It is heavily inspired by Mojang's NBT data structure but done with my
own take on it. No code has been copied and no solutions were
done by looking directly at Mojang's code.

SHCMData should resemble json a bit and also has compatible json text
conversion(WIP).
