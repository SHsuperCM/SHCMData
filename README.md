# SHCMData
SHsuperCM's Data solution



If you are looking for a way to work with the data structure in a non
programatic context, you should take a look at the UI utility
[SHCMDataEditor](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/SHCMDataEditor).

SHCMData is a (WIP) library that should hopefully become a smart sensible
data storage solution for java.

It is heavily inspired by Mojang's NBT data structure but done with my
own take on it. Note that no code has been copied and no solutions were
done by looking directly at Mojang's code.

For those unaware of the NBT structure, SHCMData should resemble json a 
bit.
